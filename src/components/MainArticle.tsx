            Students from all four houses gathered beneath the enchanted ceiling, which mirrored the stormy autumn sky outside with remarkable precision. Thousands of floating candles cast a warm, golden glow over the assembled crowd as they awaited the evening's festivities.

            "The atmosphere was absolutely electric," reported sixth-year Ravenclaw Luna Lovegood. "You could practically taste the magic in the air ‚Äì though that might have been the treacle tart."

            "Tonight, we celebrate not just the opening of our Great Hall," Dumbledore announced to thunderous applause, "but the opening of minds, hearts, and the endless possibilities that magic brings to our world."

            The evening featured performances by the Hogwarts choir, demonstrations of advanced transfiguration by Professor McGonagall, and a spectacular display of defensive charms courtesy of Professor Flitwick.
